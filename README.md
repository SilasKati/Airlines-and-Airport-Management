# Airlines-and-Airport-Management
Airlines and airport management system is a database project implemented in Oracle, primarily deals with the management of the airport, airlines, passengers and employees working for an airport. The system provides a broad overview of underlying operational factors that influence the airport management.  
  
I have also created a very basic front-end design where you can view, insert and modify the data from the webpages. 
  
Every folder is named accourdingly for your convenience.  
  
The project report file describes everything in detail.
